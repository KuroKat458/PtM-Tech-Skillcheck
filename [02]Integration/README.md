## PtM Skill Check - Integration

Congratulations for passing the first assignment. While the previous task tested general Toolkit knowledge, this task will focus on one of your main tasks as an Integration Programmer for PtM: Reviewing the PRs from the various other departments and making sure that the project doesn't fall apart. 

### Your Task:

1) Clone the repository if you haven't already.
2) Swap the branch to feature/mysterious-tavern-quest.
3) Open the INTEGRATION_Tavern level in the toolkit (where all changes have been made).
3) Review the changes on feature/mysterious-tavern-quest and send your assigned Senior or Lead a textfile which outlines all issues you found and how to replicate them once you're done.

You are given multiple documents to help you with the review.
- **MysteriousTavern.md**: This is the quest reference sheet, a document containing all information given to the programmers by the writers. It contains all features that need to be implemented for the quest and the related resources.   
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: This is our projects coding style guideline. It contains naming conventions and other important rules that must be upkept by the Integration department. For this task, any mention of PTM in the naming conventions can be replaced by SC (**S**kill**C**heck).
- **MysteriousTavernDialog.canvas**: This file contains the exact dialog as provided by the writers. To use it, download [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and open the file with that programm.

You need to make sure that everything that could have gone wrong during implementation did not do so, be that a naming mistake, quest continuity error, a bug, a missing feature, ...

This might feel overwhelming but don't worry, we are aware that you most of our new contributors might have no prior experience with the toolkit. You do not need to find everything, but we ask of you to do your best. After you complete this task, you will have a far better overview over all the things that could go wrong during a feature implementation.  

**Important**: During this part of your task, you are allowed to ask any question you can think of to your fellow contributors, as long as it isn't "What issues are there in the branch?". We still encourage trying to come up with solutions yourself and to search the moonglasses discord first but not understanding a Toolkit feature shall not be a reason for you to fail this task.
